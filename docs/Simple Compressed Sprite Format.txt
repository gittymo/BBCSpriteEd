2 Bytes :   ID "B1" 
1 Byte  :   Screen Mode
1 Byte  :   Width in pixels (short)
1 Byte  :   Height in pixels
2 Bytes :   Frame Count

(fc) Frame follow consisting of:
    2 Bytes: Frame data size in bytes.

    This is followed by any number of sub blocks defined as below.  Note that LENGTH and DATA bytes will only be present for certain block types.

    1 Byte (FORMAT)   :   Block type (ty), where the value of these bits means:
                            0   = Frame terminator block
                            1   = Jump pixels (also used to terminate the frame, see remaining bits description for ty=0)
                            2   = Raw data
                            3   = Byte pattern run Length
                            255 = Sprite terminator block

                        
    1 Byte (LENGTH)     :   (ty = 1)    :   Number of pixels to jump, less one (0-255).  
                            (ty = 2)    :   Number of raw pixels to follow, less one (0-255).
                            (ty = 3)    :   Number of bytes to fill with this pattern, less one (0-255).
                            
    n Byte(s) (DATA)    :   (ty = 2)    :   (LENGTH) x Logical colour indices representing (len) raw pixel values.  Depending on the number of colours available to the sprite's 
                                            display mode, these raw values will be stored in a byte packed format, the number of bits would be:
                                            2 colour mode = 1 bit per index (8 pixels per byte)
                                            4 colour mode = 2 bits per index (4 pixels per byte)
                                            8 colour mode = 4 bits per index (2 pixels per byte)
                                            Where (LENGTH) does not provide sufficient samples to complete a byte's bits, the remaining bits can be ignored.       
                            
                            (ty = 3)    :   A byte value that contains a screen memory compatible representation of the repeated colour pattern. 
                                            For example, in the case of a mode 1 sprite: if the run length pattern is a twice repetition of colour indexes 1 and 2, 
                                            the byte pattern value would be stored as 0b01020102.
